## 🧐 Inspiration <a name = "inspiration"></a>

I used to have a previous personal website, but recently I am not satisfy with it. Therefore, I try my best to deliver a personal profile with nice UI and added some functionalities which I learn from a project I am currently working on. 

## 🧐 about <a name = "about"></a>

My personal profile is currently deployed on aws s3 with my own domain. It is supported to display on every device by the media query. By the way it really has a good look, lol.
